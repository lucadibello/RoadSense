\section{Introduction}

The \textbf{RoadSense} project aims to develop an IoT-based system to detect and map road anomalies such as bumpiness and potholes. 
By installing sensor nodes on multiple vehicles, the system collects and analyzes road vibration data to create a detailed, interactive heatmap of road conditions. 
This information is invaluable for road maintenance planning, improving driver safety, and providing real-time alerts for hazardous conditions.

\subsection{Objectives}

This project aims to address the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Develop a cost-effective IoT-based system to detect and map road anomalies.
\item Quantify road bumpiness levels and provide real-time alerts for hazardous conditions.
\item User-friendly interface for stakeholders to visualize road conditions and manage alerts.
\item Improve the accuracy of road conditons by using multiple vehicles for data collection.
\end{enumerate}

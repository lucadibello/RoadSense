\section{Overview}

The \textbf{RoadSense} system consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sensor Nodes}: IoT devices installed in vehicles, responsible for collecting inertial data using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor and location data via a GPS module. These nodes pre-process data to compute a qualifier for localized road states, reducing the volume of data sent to the central infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Data Aggregation and Processing System}: A centralized backend platform responsible for receiving, aggregating, and analyzing data from multiple sensor nodes. This system generates detailed road quality insights and produces interactive heatmaps for visualization. It also includes mechanisms for detecting anomalies and triggering alerts.
    \item \textbf{Control Logic}: Defines the operational behavior of the IoT devices, including protocols for data collection, processing, and communication with the central system.
    \item \textbf{User Interface}: An interactive web application that enables stakeholders to visualize road conditions, explore heatmaps, and manage alerts effectively.
\end{itemize}

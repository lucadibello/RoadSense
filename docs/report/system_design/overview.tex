\section{Overview}

The \textbf{RoadSense} system consists of the following components:

he \textbf{RoadSense} system consists of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sensor Nodes}: IoT devices installed in vehicles, responsible for collecting inertial data using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor and location data via a GPS module. These nodes should already compute a qualifier for localized road states to minimize data traffic to centralized hubs.
    \item \textbf{Server-Side Application}: Collects, aggregates, and analyzes data from multiple devices, and visualizes road quality using heatmaps.
    \item \textbf{Control Logic}: Defines the behavior of the IoT device in terms of data collection, processing, and communication.
    \item \textbf{User Interface}: An interactive web application allowing stakeholders to visualize road conditions and manage alerts.
\end{itemize}

# RoadSense - requirements and specifications

## Requirements

- Create an up-to-date map with in-depth qualification of road bumpiness and hazards.
- Visualization of road conditions through a heatmap overlay on a map, with markings for potholes.
- The map must be interactive, enabling stakeholders to visualize road conditions and engage with generated alerts. This includes actions such as viewing all alerts and marking alerts as resolved.
- Distinguishing between speed bumps, manholes, road markings, and potholes in urban areas.
- Relies on data collected from multiple vehicles to ensure accuracy and coverage.
- Detects road vibrations and relates them to positional data to pinpoint road conditions.
- Scalable and cost-effective solution for widespread adoption.
- Centralized server to collect, aggregate, and analyze data from multiple devices.
- Optimized data transmission from IoT devices to the server for real-time updates.
- Noise reduction algorithms to account for different vehicle baselines and reduce data inaccuracies.
- Data transmission from the IoT device to the centralized server via Wi-Fi when in range of dedicated hotspots.
- Both battery-powered and vehicle-powered IoT devices to
- The primary energy source is the vehicle's power supply, with a backup battery to ensure data transmission when the vehicle is off.
- A compact casing should securely enclose all components, shielding them from external elements. Additionally, it should feature LEDs to indicate device status, such as transmission activity or errors.
